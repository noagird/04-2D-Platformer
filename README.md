# 2D Platformer
11/02/2022

Description
This is a quick 2D platformer I made in Godot!

## Implementation
I had included sound effects and music. I also added a background to set the scene a little bit better.

## Future Development
I need to figure out how to stop my death sound from playing on spawn. Also, would like to add enemies and some sort of fighting mechanics. More levels will also be a bonus when I get the time.
